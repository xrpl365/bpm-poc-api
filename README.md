This Dot Net solutions will run in Visual Studio Code 2022. A fork has been taken of the Xrpl.c codebase. 

Primarily to allow it to run in .Net Core, but some other changes have been made to enable NFT transactions.

Setting need to be put into \XrplNftTicketing.Api\appsettings.json

For Ipfs this app is currently using Pinata, and a free Pinata account can be used (https://app.pinata.cloud/) to get and set the key and secret in appsettings.json.

An xrpl account seed from a faucet account is also needed in appsettings.json.
